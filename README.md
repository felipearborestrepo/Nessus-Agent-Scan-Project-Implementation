# Nessus Agent Scan Project Implementation

In this project, we demonstrate the deployment of a Nessus Agent on a Windows VM in Azure, and the configuration of an authenticated vulnerability scan using Tenable’s cloud platform.

_**Inception State:**_ No Nessus Agent installed or configured, no scan group created.

_**Completion State:**_ Nessus Agent fully installed, agent group created, scan run, vulnerabilities identified, and initial assessment conducted.

# Technology Utilized
- Tenable (Nessus Agent, Tenable.io Cloud platform)
- Azure Virtual Machines (Windows 10 Pro)
- PowerShell (Agent installation and configuration)
- Tenable Agent Groups (for grouping scan targets)

## 1. VM and Nessus Agent Setup

We start by provisioning a **Windows 10 Pro** virtual machine on Azure:

## 2. Nessus Agent Group Creation
**In Tenable, I created a new Agent Group called LABUSER-Agent-Group to logically organize the agent(s):**

## 3. Nessus Agent Scan Creation
Still in Tenable, I created a Basic Agent Scan including the Agent Group created before.

**Set Scan Type to Trigger Scan, Selected Filename and then included the star.txt**

## 4. Ran Command from Tenable to intall the Agent inside the VM
Got the Command from Tenable by creating a Linked Agent, copied and pasted in Powershell inside the VM to install the Agent

![8- Get Command from Linked Agents from Creating a new agent to run in the VM to install the Agent](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46a7d650-f869-4962-9584-a00291a662ba)

![9- Inside VM ran code in Powershell to Install the Agent](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebede4ce-70a2-47a1-a747-a3c006fcdf4e)

## 5. Created the file name star.txt in PowerShell inside the VM
Used these commands to create the star.txt file so the Agent can detect, trigger and delete the file

![10- Created the star txt file to trigger the scan](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14ac16db-7459-4eae-b79e-f7fe960f9837)

![11- File showing in the folder](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/738cd3dc-8823-4d46-89d7-0b4309a586d9)

**Made sure that Tenable Nessus Agent was running in Services**

## 6. File Deleted and Results
**After 10 minutes the file star.txt was triggered and deleted from the VM**
